/*This smart contract allows members of the DAO to submit proposals, vote on proposals, and execute proposals that receive a sufficient number of votes. It also includes functions for adding and removing members, which can only be called by the owner of the DAO.

This is just one example of how a DAO smart contract can be implemented in Solidity. There are many other ways to design and implement a DAO, and you may want to consider adding additional features or functionality to your contract based on your specific needs. */
